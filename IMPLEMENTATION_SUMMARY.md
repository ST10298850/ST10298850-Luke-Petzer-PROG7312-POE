# Local Events Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Phase 1 — Core Data Layer (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: App runs, can read/write events and announcements.

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Created models (Event, Announcement) in `Models/Events.cs`
2. ✅ Added ApplicationDbContext in `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
3. ✅ Configured SQL Server connection string in `appsettings.json`
4. ✅ Created and applied initial migration
5. ✅ Added database seeder in `Data/DbSeeder.cs` with sample data
6. ✅ Integrated seeder in `Program.cs`

**Commit**: `feat: base data layer setup`

---

## ✅ Phase 2 — Service Framework (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Structure business logic layer and controller linkage.

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Defined `ILocalEventsService` interface with methods:
   - `GetAllEventsAsync()`
   - `GetAllAnnouncementsAsync()`
2. ✅ Implemented `LocalEventsService` with database retrieval
3. ✅ Registered service in `Program.cs` as scoped service
4. ✅ Created `LocalEventsController` with dependency injection
5. ✅ Controller Index() pulls data and passes to view

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Services/ILocalEventsService.cs`
- `Services/LocalEventsService.cs`
- `Controllers/LocalEventsController.cs`
- `Program.cs`

**Commit**: `feat: add service layer and controller for events display`

---

## ✅ Phase 3 — Data Structures Integration (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Store and serve events internally using correct structures.

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Implemented data structures in `LocalEventsService`:
   - `SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Event>>` - events by date
   - `Dictionary<string, List<Event>>` - events by category
   - `HashSet<string>` - unique categories
   - `PriorityQueue<Event, DateTime>` - upcoming events queue
2. ✅ Added helper methods:
   - `GetUpcomingEventsAsync()` - returns events from priority queue
   - `GetEventsByCategoryAsync(string category)` - returns events by category
   - `GetCategoriesAsync()` - returns all unique categories
3. ✅ Implemented lazy loading with `LoadEventsIntoStructuresAsync()`
4. ✅ Methods return flattened lists to controller

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Data structures are loaded once on first access
- `_isLoaded` flag prevents duplicate loading
- Only future events are added to priority queue
- All structures are populated from the same database query

**Commit**: `feat: implement core event data structures`

---

## ✅ Phase 4 — ViewModel and Display Logic (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: UI receives organized data with conditional rendering.

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Created `LocalEventsViewModel` containing:
   - `IEnumerable<Event> Events`
   - `IEnumerable<Announcement> Announcements`
   - `IEnumerable<string> Categories`
2. ✅ Updated controller to map service data to ViewModel
3. ✅ Updated Razor view with:
   - Conditional rendering for events/announcements
   - Category dropdown populated from ViewModel
   - Event cards with formatted dates and categories
   - Announcement cards with distinct styling
   - Empty state handling

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `ViewModels/LocalEventsViewModel.cs` (new)
- `Controllers/LocalEventsController.cs` (updated)
- `Views/LocalEvents/Index.cshtml` (updated)

**Commit**: `feat: integrate viewmodel and conditional rendering`

## Database Seeding

The application includes sample data:

**Events** (5 items):
- Community Town Hall Meeting (Government Meetings)
- Summer Festival 2025 (Community Events)
- Public Safety Workshop (Public Safety)
- Parks & Recreation Cleanup Day (Parks & Recreation)
- Cultural Heritage Festival (Cultural Events)

**Announcements** (5 items):
- New Recycling Program Launched
- Road Construction on Main Street
- City Budget Meeting Results
- New Community Center Opening
- Winter Weather Preparation

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow:
```
Database (SQL Server)
    ↓
ApplicationDbContext
    ↓
LocalEventsService (with data structures)
    ↓
LocalEventsController
    ↓
LocalEventsViewModel
    ↓
Index.cshtml (Razor View)
```

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Scoped Service**: `LocalEventsService` is registered as scoped to allow per-request data structure initialization
2. **Lazy Loading**: Data structures are populated on first access, not in constructor
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Controller is thin, business logic in service layer
4. **ViewModel Pattern**: Clean separation between data and presentation

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- Implement client-side filtering with JavaScript
- Add search functionality to filter events
- Implement date range filtering
- Add pagination for large event lists
- Create event detail pages
- Add admin CRUD operations for events/announcements

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to `/LocalEvents/Index`
- [ ] Verify events display with proper formatting
- [ ] Verify announcements display
- [ ] Verify category dropdown is populated
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Verify empty state handling (delete all events to test)

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful** - All phases implemented and compiling without errors.
