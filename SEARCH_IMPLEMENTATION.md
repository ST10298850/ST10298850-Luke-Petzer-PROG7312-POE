# Search Functionality Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Service Layer (LocalEventsService.cs)**
- ‚úÖ **SearchEventsAsync method** - Filters events by name, category, and date
  - Uses `AsQueryable()` to build efficient database queries
  - Applies filters conditionally (only when parameters are provided)
  - Case-insensitive search using `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`
  - Returns filtered results asynchronously

**Key Features:**
- Partial match for event name (e.g., "Clean" matches "Community Clean-Up Day")
- Exact match for category
- Date range filtering (start date and end date support)

### 2. **Controller Layer (LocalEventsController.cs)**
- ‚úÖ **Updated Index action** to accept search parameters:
  - `searchName` - Event name/keyword
  - `category` - Category filter
  - `date` - Date filter

**Logic Flow:**
1. Check if any search parameters are provided
2. If yes ‚Üí call `SearchEventsAsync()` with filters
3. If no ‚Üí call `GetUpcomingEventsAsync()` to show all events
4. Record the search for future recommendation tracking
5. Build ViewModel and return to view

### 3. **View Layer (Index.cshtml)**
- ‚úÖ **Form submission** using GET method
  - Form parameters match controller action parameters exactly
  - Preserves search values after form submission using `Context.Request.Query[]`
  - Category dropdown maintains selected value after search
  - Date input retains selected date

**Form Fields:**
- `searchName` - Text input for event name/keyword
- `category` - Dropdown populated from database categories
- `date` - Date picker for filtering by date

**Buttons:**
- "Search Events" - Submits the form with all filters
- "Clear Filters" - Reloads page without any query parameters

### 4. **Enhanced UX (localevents.js) - OPTIONAL**
- ‚úÖ **Debounce functionality** - Delays search until user stops typing (500ms)
- ‚úÖ **Instant search** on category/date change
- ‚úÖ **Two implementation options:**
  - Option 1: Simple URL reload (currently active)
  - Option 2: AJAX fetch (commented out, ready to use)

## üìã How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **User enters search criteria** in the filter form
2. **Form submits to `/LocalEvents/Index`** with query parameters
   - Example: `/LocalEvents/Index?searchName=clean&category=Community&date=2024-10-20`
3. **Controller receives parameters** and checks if any are provided
4. **Service layer queries database** with applied filters
5. **Results are returned** to the controller
6. **ViewModel is built** with filtered events, announcements, and categories
7. **View displays results** with search criteria preserved in form fields

### Example Searches:

```
- Search by name only: ?searchName=festival
- Search by category: ?category=Community Events
- Search by date: ?date=2024-10-20
- Combined search: ?searchName=clean&category=Community&date=2024-10-20
```

## üîç Code Comments Explained

All code includes detailed comments explaining:
- **What each section does**
- **Why it's implemented that way**
- **How the data flows**
- **What each parameter means**

### Key Comments Added:

**Service Layer:**
- How `AsQueryable()` works
- Why we use `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`
- How `Contains()` vs `Equals()` differ
- When the database query actually executes

**Controller:**
- How parameter binding works from query string
- Why we check for null/empty values
- How the search is recorded for recommendations
- What happens when no filters are provided

**View:**
- How form submission works with GET method
- How to preserve form values after submission
- Why we use `asp-controller` and `asp-action`
- How the "Clear Filters" button works

**JavaScript:**
- How debounce prevents excessive API calls
- Why we use 500ms delay
- Difference between instant search and debounced search
- Two implementation options (reload vs AJAX)

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to `/LocalEvents/Index`
- [ ] Enter a search term and click "Search Events"
- [ ] Verify results are filtered correctly
- [ ] Verify search term remains in the input field after search
- [ ] Select a category and search
- [ ] Verify category remains selected after search
- [ ] Select a date and search
- [ ] Verify date remains selected after search
- [ ] Click "Clear Filters" - verify all filters are cleared
- [ ] Test combined filters (name + category + date)

## üéØ What's Still Needed for Full Marks

This implementation covers the **Search Functionality** requirement. You still need:

1. ‚ùå **Stack/Queue for search history** (15 marks)
2. ‚ùå **Personalized recommendations** based on search patterns (30 marks)

The current implementation includes:
- ‚úÖ Search by name, category, and date
- ‚úÖ All required data structures (Dictionary, SortedDictionary, HashSet, PriorityQueue)
- ‚úÖ User-friendly presentation
- ‚úÖ Form state preservation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Search recording (stub only - needs full implementation for recommendations)

## üìù Next Steps

To complete the assignment:
1. Implement search history using Queue/Stack
2. Build recommendation algorithm based on user search patterns
3. Display personalized recommendations (not just first 3 events)
